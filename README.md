## Introduction
As targeting Mobile App for different platforms become more tedious and costly for vendors , cross platform app development frameworks are now getting popularity. Till now we don't have an Industry standard Framework which will in true sense solve the fragmentation issue between making app for Android , iPhone , Blackberry and J2ME devices .

"PhoneGap" is one such Framework. But it has it's own limitation and will get mature in time

###PureMVC comes as a rescue
Most of the time Mobile development is based on understanding the Business Logic and mold it in the MVC pattern.

Pure MVC helps us to purely separate the interaction between Model-View-Controller by means of Proxy , Mediator and Facade.

This makes it perfectly platform neutral approach as for a developer he don't need to redefined the interaction(event/message passing ) between model-view-controller , and he will concentrate mostly on Business use case implementation once it's been been designed in any Platform .

This also make the programming logic unique for Different group of developer who is responsible for handling different platform and any issue will be easily discussed and resolved.

This is a perfect framework for targeting enhancements and managing the feature set for a App which is planning to target for different Platforms.

####PureMVC port & Sample App
Pure MVC port is provided in the Source , as I don't able to find any suitable port for Blackberry here along with a simple sample App.
